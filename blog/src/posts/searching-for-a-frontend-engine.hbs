<p>One of the first thing you need to do when making a browser-based game is to decide on technologies used and then see if there is an engine with enough flexibility and power to support the vision of you game. In my prior attempts I've been playing with few different engines including <a href="http://melonjs.org/" target="_blank">MelonJS</a> and <a href="http://gamejs.org/" target="_blank">GameJS</a>. However neither of them would be suitable for the game I had in mind. Because I want to write a game and not yet another engine, I've been experimenting with various engines using <a href="https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki/Game-Engines" target="_blank">this list</a> as a starting point. After fooling around with few more options I've settled down for <a href="http://www.playcraftlabs.com/">Playcraft</a> - it's a commercial solution but comes with source code and a license friendly to indie developers.</p>
